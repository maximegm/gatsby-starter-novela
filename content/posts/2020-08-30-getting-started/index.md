# From running to Running

In Boston I would run with my dog to stay in shape and tire him out. The idea never came to me to train for any sort of race or competitive event.

At the time I had worked as a bike messenger on and off for 3 years and that was my daily dose of "endurance training" if we can call it that.

I new people who were training for the Boston Marathon and even triathlon, but the the idea was completely oulandish to me. Why would you want to run for several hours alongside and against thousands of strangers.

They say it starts with a spark, for me it was a lightning strike.



The basics of training?
