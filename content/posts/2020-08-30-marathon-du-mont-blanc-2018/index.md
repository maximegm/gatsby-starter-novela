2017 was a hard year, loss, dwindling mental health, moving from Chamonix in the Alps to Paris. Your mind and body can only take so much before you start feeling the toll.

The time of year was coming around... registration for the Marahon du Mont Blanc race. In 2016 I had decided to sign up for the Vertical Kilometer followed by the "Cross" - a 23km semi - the next day. Back then I wasn't training actively, I'd go for runs with friends and/or my dog around the valley, but never had a training plan. The VK was a fun endeavor, I finished in under an hour and beat my own PR! The following day my IT band was acting up and before the end opf the race, my hips and knees were not happy, yet I finished just under 5 hours, coming in during a thunderstorm, tired but feeling accomplished.

I navigated to the MMB website, picked the VK and the cross again, thinking I'd be able to train and beat my previous times... But what if I tried the full marathon distance ? 42km and 2700m+ of D+... At the time I had never ran more than 25km in one day. How much time would it take to finish ? Could I finish ? What if I got injured ? Maybe I can just try and drop out if it gets too hard. All these thoughts came pouring into my mind until I did it. I scrolled down the list of distances, picked the MMB 42km, put in my information and confirmed my entry into the 2018 lottery. By the end of the year I would have confirmation if I would be racing in July!

A few months later I received an email for the *Club des Sports de Chamonix -* a tense moment, I scrolled through the email anxioulsy looking for "unfortunately", "we regret", "next year". I had been picked ! I was ecstatic ! The utter joy lasted moments as I soon realized the second part of what this meant: time to get a proper training plan together and get in racing shape!

This was December, the race was the !st of July, that meant 26 weeks of prep and training - 6 months of full on training planning and 2 weeks of tapering.. What did this mean in practical terms though ? I wasn't living in the mountains anymore, Paris is pretty flat with the exception of a few mounds thorughout the city and some sort of hilly forest around it. I was pretty clueless. What kind of gear would I need ? what about nutrition ? SHould I train with other people ?
